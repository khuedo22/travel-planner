# Travel Planner and Diary

### *Description*
This application will allow users to plan and organize their travels. Users can use this application to plan their 
itinerary, input information about the date, time, duration, transportation information, travel directions, price,
and any additional information they want to add. Users can edit any information at any time. 


This project interests me because there are many places I want to travel to, but everytime I travel,
I am always disorganized. I lose track of important information and can't decide about what to do during the trip. This travel application will allow me to keep track
of and organize the information so I am better prepared when travelling and have a reference in case I am unsure about anything.
