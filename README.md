# Travel Planner and Diary

### Description
This application will allow users to plan and document their travels. Users can use this application to brainstorm
ideas for their upcoming trip, upload information about their plane tickets, hotel information, and other logistics, create
a schedule of their entire trip, alter that schedule anytime, and document their experiences during the trip by writing diary entries.

This project interests me because there are many places I want to travel to, but everytime I travel,
I am always disorganized. I lose track of important information and can't decide about what to do during the trip. This travel application will allow me to keep track
of and organize the information so I am better prepared when travelling and have a reference in case I am unsure about anything.
